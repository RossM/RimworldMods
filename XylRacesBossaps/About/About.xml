  <name>Posthuman Drift: Bossaps Xenotype [beta v0.5]</name>
  <author>Xylthixlm</author>
  <description>
    Adds the Bossaps xenotype and associated genes.

    Bossaps were engineered as sentient livestock by the gene-artisans of a glitterworld best left forgotten. When things are peaceful they are calm and mild-mannered. But when they're hurt, instinct takes over, and they charge their enemies like a raging bull.

    This mod includes one new xenotype and 12 new genes (1 cosmetic).

    [list]
    [*] [b]Herbivores:[/b] Bossaps's unique stomachs allow them to get full nutrition from raw plants, but at the price of getting less nutrition from meat - including cooked meals containing meat.
    [*] [b]Docile...[/b] Engineered to be easy to control, Bossaps are inherently calm, and resist much less than other xenotypes as prisoners or slaves. They also have messed-up pain senses that give them a guaranteed Masochist trait.
    [*] [b]... Until provoked:[/b] They're only docile on the surface, though. Their horns can deal serious damage in melee, and when injured they may enter a berserk state where they feel almost no pain and won't stop fighting until all their enemies are down - or they are.
    [*] [b]Milk:[/b] Milk? Milk. Enough said.
    [/list]
